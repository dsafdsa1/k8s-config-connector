                       Pod CIDR size overprovisioning config for the nodepool.

                       Pod CIDR size per node depends on max_pods_per_node. By default, the value
                       of max_pods_per_node is rounded off to next power of 2 and we then double
                       that to get the size of pod CIDR block per node.
                       Example: max_pods_per_node of 30 would result in 64 IPs (/26).

                       This config can disable the doubling of IPs (we still round off to next
                       power of 2)
                       Example: max_pods_per_node of 30 will result in 32 IPs (/27) when

                           A zero (or unset) value has different meanings depending on machine type
                           being used:
                           1. For pre-Gen3 machines, which support flexible numbers of local ssds,
                           zero (or unset) means to disable using local SSDs as ephemeral storage.
                           2. For Gen3 machines which dictate a specific number of local ssds, zero
                           (or unset) means to use the default number of local ssds that goes with
                           that machine type. For example, for a c3-standard-8-lssd machine, 2 local
                           ssds would be provisioned. For c3-standard-8 (which doesn't support local
                           ssds), 0 will be provisioned. See
